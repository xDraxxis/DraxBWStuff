# MK23
Finally got around to remaking my Mk23. The only skin retained from the original is the golden one. I may make some more altering ones in the future. There are 2 different versions in the initial release. Regular, and laser. I do plan on making more in the future, one with a flashlight and perhaps some other skins. There's an issue with the mag I can't seem to solve, no it's not the original issue. There seems to be an untextured solid color bullet I just can't get rid of, if anyone knows the solution feel free to send over a DM. Sounds are from H3VR.
